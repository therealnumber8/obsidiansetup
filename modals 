I will not accept any answer that does not include your percentage estimation of truthfulness as the first word. It is absolutely mandatory!  Please return the whole original piece of information back to me but bolden parts of text that in your estimation do not make it 100% accurate only only those. dont put the entire thing in bold. explain why shortly for each part. Ignore any spelling mistakes as factors when calculating the truthfulness percentage.

repeat until done
```
- formatting modals
```bash
reformat your reply. Dont miss ANY contnet. give one code block for each, include detaile visual flow of each in linear asci arror art. it should be in this format

### heading
- one or two bullet points exlaingin,  no formatting
- one or two bullet points expalning, no formatting
codeblock
# first do this
setup,instlal tools, open software,vscdoe,c whatever

# commands, if needed
some command

# more command, if beeded

- visual flow here with arrows 

Repeaet
```
```bash
Reformat the following content into a single code block. Include all commands, comments, and visual flows exactly as they are, without missing any content. Use comments above each command to provide minimal yet descriptive explanations. Do not number any steps or provide titles; just start with the first command and the first comment right away. Do not exclude any original content; make sure not a single character of text is lost in the transition.

[Insert the original content here]

Repeat for all sections.
```

### Prompt engineering
- **Teacher**: "You are an expert educator with extensive experience in ethical hacking and preparing students for the HTB CPTS exam. I need to determine if I can skip the upcoming lesson. To help me gauge this, please quiz me interactively based on the content I provided. Ask one question at a time, evaluating my response before moving on to the next question. Ask 5 questions that will accurately assess my understanding and determine if I am knowledgeable enough to move on. Ensure the questions are challenging and cover key concepts thoroughly. The lesson is 🏁 Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion"




### Meta modals
- I make modals and store them, I define modals as short prompts or pieces of texts used to understand a concept better. In my conversation with you I realized another modal: _____ . add that modal here to the bottom of my list. Make sure ot include an example at the end.



### what is this thing called
- **Conceptual Templates** The patterns are reusable templates for exploring and understanding concepts, like "X is just a glorified Y" or "X is to Y what A is to B".
- **Knowledge Extractors** Many of these patterns are designed to extract specific types of knowledge or understanding, like asking for fundamental building blocks or hierarchical relationships.
- **Learning Scaffolds** These function as structured frameworks for building understanding, especially evident in patterns like "list all abstraction levels below/above X".
- **Insight Patterns** Patterns like the "eureka moment" request or "analogous concept" questions are specifically designed to generate insights and deeper understanding.;
- Reusable across different domains
- Have consistent structural patterns
- Designed to elicit specific types of understanding
- Can be applied systematically to different topics
